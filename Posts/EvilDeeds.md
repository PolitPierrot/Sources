## Tables

* Columns:
  1. States (and DC).
  2. Percentage increase since 25 May 2020.
  3. Cases per million (25 May 2020).
  4. Cases per million (30 August 2020).

## Calculations

### Percentage Increase

$$ increase = (\frac{cases_b}{cases_a} - 1) \times 100 $$

Using Montana on 30 August for example,
$$ increase = (\frac{6868}{448}-1) \times 100 = 1433 $$
