# The Eye of Chauvin

A sixty-second clip alluding to the fact that the courts do not have any meaningful body camera footage for Derek Chauvin. The true reason for their refusal to acknowledge this is becoming self-evident, given the support for the riots.

## Sources

- Darnella Frazier's cell phone footage.
- J. Alexander Kueng's bodycam footage.
- Thomas Lane's bodycam footage.
- Tou Thao's bodycam footage.
